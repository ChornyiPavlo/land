        <h1>Dice Dreams | Responsible Social Gaming</h1>
        <p>Dice Dreams is committed to supporting responsible gaming as a policy of customer care and social responsibility.</p>
<p>We believe that we have a responsibility to you, our customers, to ensure that you enjoy your experience on our platform while remaining fully aware of the potential risks associated with PC gaming if you do not maintain control.</p>
<p>To ensure that you continue to enjoy a safe and managed gaming experience, we fully support responsible gaming and have taken steps to help players who want to be in control of their gambling.</p>

<h2>1. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR GAME</h2>
<p>Computer games should be treated as a fun pastime. Here are some tips to help you stay in control of the game:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Playing computer games is a form of entertainment, but they should be played in moderation, not to escape reality or generate income by winning prizes.</li>
    <li>Watch the time: We're so glad you're here and hope you can keep playing, but don't let PC games take up too much of your time. Just like going to the movies or bowling, we're here when you need to be entertained.</li>
    <li>Take advantage of our game management tools: If you need a time-out, you can take a break from the game at any time by following the steps outlined in section 2.</li>
    <li>If you think you're playing too often, then you may find it helpful to consider the self-assessment questions in section 3 below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. CONTROL OVER THE SITUATION</h2>
<p>We encourage our customers to gamble responsibly, which is why we offer a variety of responsible gaming features.</p>

<h3>Self-exclusion and account closure options</h3>
<p>If you feel that you want to take a break or that your gaming has become problematic, you can voluntarily exclude yourself from the Dice Dreams platform using the tools provided in the "Profile" section of the website. You can request an exemption from the Dice Dreams platform by selecting one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Forever" (Permanent Self-Exclusion) By selecting this option and clicking on "Permanent Block", you will not be able to use our services indefinitely. This action cannot be undone by you or anyone in Dice Dreams.</li>
    <li>for the selected period (Limited Timeout) by selecting the desired refund date and then clicking "Timeout".</li>
</ul>
<p>The option you select takes effect immediately. If, after this, you find that you are still able to access the Dice Dreams platform, it is your responsibility to inform us immediately by email.</p>
<p>During any exclusion period, you will not have access to the Dice Dreams platform. If you need access to your account history and/or information, you will need to send an email to the customer support team.</p>
<p>After the limited timeout expires, your access to the Dice Dreams platform will be restored.</p>
<p>Once you have self-excluded and for the duration of your self-exclusion, you will no longer receive marketing communications from us. We strongly recommend that you also seek exclusion from all other gaming platforms where you have an active account. If you use social media, you should take steps to avoid receiving news or updates from us.</p>
<p>Once self-exclusion (or any other type of closure) has been applied and for the duration of the self-exclusion, you will no longer receive any marketing material from us, however it may take up to 24 hours for the system to be updated, so you may receive marketing materials during this time, please ignore them.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you also seek exclusion from all other gaming platforms where you have an active account. If you use social media, you should take steps to avoid receiving news or updates from us.</p>
<p>We may exclude you from the Dice Dreams platform permanently or for a Limited Waiting Period at our sole discretion if there is reason to indicate that you may have problems with computer games.</p>

<h2>Stop playing/closing your account</h2>
<p>You can close your account. If you wish to do so, please send a written request to customer service via email to _client-support@protonmail.com.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to refuse or close a Client's Account at our sole discretion, but any contractual obligations already undertaken will be fulfilled accordingly.</p>

<h2>Exclusion by Unregistered Players</h2>
<p>You can also voluntarily exclude yourself from the Dice Dreams platform if you do not have a customer account. If you wish to do so, you must send an email to _client-support@protonmail.com with your full name, full residential address, email address and age so that we can block you from registering and playing on the Dice Dreams platform in the future. This self-exclusion will only be revoked 7 days after we receive your written email asking us to ignore your previous self-exclusion request.</p>

<h2>Activity Report</h2>
<p>Information related to your games can be viewed in the "Game History" section of the Dice Dreams website and in the "Transaction History" section of the platform. For information relating to your game that goes beyond any entries displayed in the Game History, please contact customer service via email.</p>

<h2>3. SELF-ASSESSMENT</h2>
<p>If you think that your or someone else's computer game is becoming problematic, then you may find it helpful to consider the self-assessment questions below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do you often relive your gaming experience or think about the future?</li>
    <li>Do you hide or lie about your games?</li>
    <li>Do you get angry when someone or something interrupts the game?</li>
    <li>Have you ever taken a break from gaming and snacked uncontrollably when you returned?</li>
    <li>When you're frustrated, do you calm yourself down with games or do you plan to play?</li>
    <li>Do you play early in the morning?</li>
    <li>Do you find ways to play away from home?</li>
    <li>Do you set limits on games and then break them by playing for hours longer than intended?</li>
    <li>Do you lose hours of sleep because of gaming?</li>
    <li>Are you sick, late for work, or skipping class to play?</li>
    <li>Have you ever given up on a game, deleted it, and then returned to it?</li>
    <li>Do you feel guilty and ashamed about your game?</li>
    <li>Does gambling contribute to fights in your relationship?</li>
    <li>Have gaming replaced any hobbies or sports you enjoyed?</li>
    <li>Do you forget about appointments, responsibilities, or deadlines at work or school when you're playing?</li>
    <li>Do you get irritated and defensive when people assume you gamble too much?</li>
    <li>Has the time you spend playing games increased over time?</li>
    <li>Do you transfer social events to the game?</li>
    <li>Have you lost touch with friends and family after playing?</li>
    <li>Do you experience strong feelings (ups, downs, anger, fear) while playing?</li>
</ul>
<p>The more questions you answer yes to, the more likely you are to have difficulty with the game, although some of them may be perfectly normal. To speak with someone who can give you advice and support, contact the support organizations mentioned in section 4 below.</p>

<h2>4. AUXILIARY ORGANIZATIONS</h2>
<p>If you would like to access help and support for people who have been negatively impacted by gaming, we advise you to contact Computer Gaming Addicts Anonymous (CGAA) at the following email address: <a href="mailto:helpline@cgaa.info">helpline@cgaa.info</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Please note that CGAAs are independent support services and are NOT affiliated with Dice Dreams in any way. CGAA does not provide customer support or dispute resolution services. If you would like to discuss any question or complaint related to your account, you can do so by contacting us via email <a href="mailto:_client-support@protonmail.com">at _client-support@protonmail.com</a>.</p>

<h3>PLAYER PROTECTION POLICY</h3>

<h4>1. PROTECTION OF MINORS</h4>
<p>With internet access via mobile devices and homes around the world, responsible gaming relies heavily on parental controls and supervision. To ensure children's online safety, we encourage our customers to use filtering software to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate online material.</p>

<h4>2. TIPS FOR PARENTS</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your username and password in a safe place.</li>
    <li>Do not leave your computer or device unattended when logging into your account.</li>
    <li>Don't use Remember Me on a shared computer or device, especially if you share your computer or device with your children.</li>
    <li>Be especially cautious about the use of all electronic and mobile devices by minors.</li>
    <li>Do not allow minors (under 18 years of age) to participate in any gaming activity intended for adults (+18 years old).</li>
